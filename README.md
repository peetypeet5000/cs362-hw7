# CS 362 Homework 7
### Test-Driven Development
This homework tested our ability to write tests and then design the implimentation to pass these tests. See the commit history for an example of writing tests first and then modifying code to make them pass.

### Test FizzBuzz
This is the classic FizzBuzz program. The tests were designed to check if the mod 3 inputs returned `Fizz`, the mod 5 inputs returned `Buzz`, the inputs that are devisible by both return `FizzBuzz`, and those that meet none of the criteria return the number.


### Test Leapyear
The tests added one condition of the leap year formula each time, starting with years devisible by 4 being leap, those devisible by 100 not being leap, and those devisible by 400 being leap.
